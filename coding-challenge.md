# Coding challenge

## General

Your task is to create a simple web-based interface for managing users saved in a relational database. Please use following technologies to create that app:

For front-end:  
* HTML
* CSS, SCSS/SASS or less
* react + redux

For back-end:
* nodejs
* MySQL or PostgreSQL
* Optional: docker(-compose)

Please use a REST-based API to communicate between front- and back-end. An authentication system (login form, logout) is not part of the task. The app should contain several pages, which are described in next sections. You are free to design an appropriate database schema.

After you have completed the task, please send us a zip file with your source code, a SQL dump and a README file with instructions to run the project.  Afterwards you have to give a short presentation (~15 min) about your implementation.

Good luck!
